1. **Fixed Pulley System**  
   A 3D model of a fixed pulley system with a rope running over a stationary pulley, lifting a load. Show the direction change of force clearly.

2. **Movable Pulley System**  
   3D model of a movable pulley with a rope running through it, demonstrating how the pulley reduces the effort needed to lift a load.

3. **Block and Tackle**  
   3D representation of a block and tackle pulley system, with multiple fixed and movable pulleys lifting a heavy load.

4. **Pulley with Load and Effort**  
   3D model showing the relationship between a load at one end and the effort force applied at the other, with clear labels.

5. **Pulley with Variable Load**  
   Interactive 3D model where the weight being lifted can be adjusted, showing how the effort force changes with different loads.

6. **Inclined Pulley with Sliding Rope**  
   A 3D model of a pulley system set on an inclined plane, where the rope slides, demonstrating the combined effect of pulleys and inclined planes.

7. **Double Pulley with Fixed and Movable Setup**  
   3D model showing how a fixed pulley and movable pulley work together, lifting a load with clear effort force and load indicators.

8. **Pulley with a Drum Mechanism**  
   A rotating drum pulley system in 3D, where the rope winds around the drum, showing mechanical advantage through size variations.

9. **Multiple Pulleys for Precision Movement**  
   3D model of a system with multiple pulleys, showing precision movement of an object with multiple adjustable pulleys.

10. **Interactive Pulley System**  
    Interactive 3D model where users can change the number of pulleys or adjust their positions to see how the force required changes.
