## Minimum Dimensions for Printing

At least one of the dimensions (length, width, or height) must be a minimum of 1 inch.

## Objective

The goal is to minimize the printing cost.

## Cost Calculation

To estimate the printing cost, please test using the following link: [Dwart Industries FDM 3D Printing Service](https://dwartindustries.com/fdm-3d-printing-service).

# Tinkercad 3D Designing Methods

## Basic Shape Operations
- **Adding Shapes** – Drag and drop basic 3D shapes like cubes, spheres, cylinders, cones, and pyramids.
- **Grouping & Ungrouping** – Combine multiple shapes into one or separate them.
- **Hole & Cut Operations** – Convert shapes into holes to carve out sections from other objects.
- **Resizing & Scaling** – Adjust the size of objects by dragging corner handles.
- **Rotating & Flipping** – Rotate objects in any direction (X, Y, Z axes).
- **Aligning Objects** – Use the align tool to position objects precisely.
- **Duplicating & Mirroring** – Create copies and flip objects to make symmetrical designs.

## Advanced Shape Modifications
- **Custom Shapes with Scribble Tool** – Draw freehand shapes and turn them into 3D objects.
- **Shape Generators** – Use pre-made complex shapes and modify them.
- **Importing 3D Models** – Upload STL or OBJ files for further customization.
- **Extruding & Lofting** – Create extruded shapes using the text or scribble tool.
- **Beveling & Rounding Edges** – Modify edges to create smooth, rounded designs.

## Measurement & Precision
- **Ruler Tool** – Add precise measurements for accuracy.
- **Workplane Adjustments** – Change the workplane position for complex designs.
- **Snap Grid Settings** – Fine-tune movements by adjusting the grid size.
- **Angle Snapping** – Rotate objects in fixed increments.

## Text & Engraving
- **Adding 3D Text** – Customize text with fonts and depth settings.
- **Engraving Using Holes** – Subtract text or patterns from surfaces to engrave designs.

## Color & Visual Modifications
- **Changing Object Colors** – Assign different colors to objects.
- **Transparency & Visibility** – Adjust transparency to see overlapping parts.
- **Hiding & Showing Parts** – Temporarily hide objects for better workspace management.

## Special Features
- **Codeblocks (Programming-based Designing)** – Use block coding to generate 3D models.
- **Circuit Integration** – Combine electronic components with 3D models.
- **Simulating Mechanical Movements** – Check how parts fit and move together.

## Exporting & 3D Printing
- **Exporting as STL, OBJ, or SVG** – Save files for 3D printing or laser cutting.
- **3D Print Compatibility Check** – Ensure the design is printable.
