### **Levers:**

11. **First-Class Lever**  
    3D model of a first-class lever (like a seesaw), with the fulcrum between the effort and load, demonstrating how force is amplified.

12. **Second-Class Lever**  
    3D model of a second-class lever, like a wheelbarrow, where the load is between the fulcrum and the effort force, demonstrating mechanical advantage.

13. **Third-Class Lever**  
    3D representation of a third-class lever, like a fishing rod, showing how it amplifies speed and distance instead of force.

14. **Lever with Adjustable Fulcrum**  
    3D model showing a lever with an adjustable fulcrum, allowing the user to see how position changes the mechanical advantage.

15. **Lever with Variable Load**  
    3D model of a lever where the load and effort can be adjusted, demonstrating how force is related to distance from the fulcrum.

16. **Lever with Multiple Supports**  
    A 3D model of a complex lever with multiple fulcrum points, balancing various forces to show how levers can work together.

17. **Double Lever Mechanism**  
    3D model of a double lever system, where two levers work together to lift or move a load with less effort.

18. **Lever with Rotating Load**  
    A lever with a rotating load, showing how force applied on the lever can move a load in a circular motion around the fulcrum.

19. **Lever with Different Length Arms**  
    A lever with different length arms on either side of the fulcrum, showing how varying arm lengths affect the force needed to balance the load.
