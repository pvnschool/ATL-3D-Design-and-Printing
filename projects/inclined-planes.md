### **Inclined Planes:**

20. **Basic Inclined Plane**  
    3D model of a simple inclined plane with an object sliding up, showing how it reduces the force needed to lift the object.

21. **Inclined Plane with Varying Angles**  
    A 3D model of an inclined plane with an adjustable angle to demonstrate how the steepness affects the effort force required to move an object.

22. **Inclined Plane with Friction**  
    3D model of an inclined plane with friction added to show how the force required to move an object increases with friction.

23. **Wedge and Inclined Plane Combination**  
    3D representation of a wedge placed on an inclined plane, showing how a wedge splits or lifts objects using an inclined surface.

24. **Roller Inclined Plane**  
    3D model of an inclined plane with rollers underneath, reducing friction and showing how the effort to move an object is minimized.

25. **Double Inclined Plane**  
    A design where two inclined planes meet at different angles, showing how combining multiple planes can reduce the effort required to lift a load.

26. **Inclined Plane with Varying Masses**  
    A model where users can change the mass of an object on an inclined plane, showing how the effort required changes with different weights.

27. **Spiral Inclined Plane**  
    3D model of a spiral inclined plane, with adjustable radius and angle, showing how circular motion can aid in moving objects up or down.

28. **Inclined Plane with Elevation Markers**  
    3D model showing different height markers on an inclined plane to visualize how the force required to move an object changes at various heights.
