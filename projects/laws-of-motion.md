# 3D Printable Projects on Newton's Laws of Motion

### **1. Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia) - Car at Rest**

- **Project Description:**  
  A model of a car on a flat surface, with a removable weight placed inside it. The car remains at rest unless a force (push) is applied. This project will demonstrate how an object at rest will stay at rest until acted upon by an external force.
- **Printable Components:**  
  - Car chassis with wheels  
  - Removable weight piece  
  - Base surface (for flat motion)
  
### **2. Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia) - Rolling Ball**

- **Project Description:**  
  A ball resting on a flat surface that remains at rest until a force (such as a gentle push) causes it to roll. It will also show that the ball keeps moving at a constant speed unless an external force, like friction or a barrier, acts upon it.
- **Printable Components:**  
  - Ball  
  - Inclined ramp (to initiate motion)  
  - Flat surface  
  - Optional: A "barrier" to stop the ball after it rolls
  
### **3. Newton's Second Law (Force = Mass × Acceleration) - Car with Different Masses**

- **Project Description:**  
  A 3D model of a toy car and interchangeable weights to demonstrate how increasing the mass of an object results in slower acceleration when the same force is applied. The car will move faster with less weight and slower with more weight.
- **Printable Components:**  
  - Car body with a slot for weights  
  - Different weight blocks  
  - Track for the car to roll
  
### **4. Newton's Second Law - Push and Accelerating Object**

- **Project Description:**  
  A model that lets students push a car or object and measure its acceleration. The model can have a spring-loaded force measurement device to show the relationship between force applied and the acceleration of an object.
- **Printable Components:**  
  - Car body with spring-based force sensor attachment  
  - Ramp or flat track  
  - Spring mechanism for force measurement
  
### **5. Newton's Third Law (Action and Reaction) - Rocket Launcher**

- **Project Description:**  
  A model of a small rocket launcher where the rocket is propelled by the action of gas released from a nozzle. The reaction is the rocket moving in the opposite direction of the gas release. This model will help illustrate how every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
- **Printable Components:**  
  - Rocket body  
  - Launcher base with a nozzle  
  - Spring or air pump mechanism to propel the rocket
  
### **6. Newton's Third Law - Balloon Propulsion**

- **Project Description:**  
  A 3D model of a balloon-powered car. When the air escapes from the balloon, the car moves in the opposite direction, demonstrating Newton's Third Law of Motion.
- **Printable Components:**  
  - Car chassis with wheels  
  - Balloon holder and nozzle  
  - Balloon (removable for refills)  
  - Base surface for the car to move on
  
### **7. Newton's First and Second Laws - Pendulum Motion**

- **Project Description:**  
  A pendulum setup that shows both Newton's First and Second Laws in action: the pendulum will stay in motion (unless friction or an external force stops it), and the acceleration of the pendulum is directly related to the gravitational force and its mass.
- **Printable Components:**  
  - Pendulum rod and ball  
  - Pivot point and base stand  
  - Scale markings for measuring displacement
  
### **8. Newton’s Second Law - Car Ramp with Adjustable Force**

- **Project Description:**  
  A car on a ramp that can be adjusted for different angles, showing how acceleration changes as the ramp angle increases. This will show how force (gravity) and the angle of the ramp interact to accelerate the car.
- **Printable Components:**  
  - Car with wheels  
  - Adjustable ramp with angle markers  
  - Track for the car to travel on
  
### **9. Newton’s Third Law - Tug-of-War Model**

- **Project Description:**  
  A model where two individuals pull on a rope attached to a wall, with force measurement indicators. This project demonstrates how each person exerts an equal and opposite force on the rope.
- **Printable Components:**  
  - Two handles with attachment points for a rope  
  - Wall bracket for securing the rope  
  - Force measurement gauge for each person
  
### **10. Newton’s First Law - Floating Objects with Air Pressure**

- **Project Description:**  
  A 3D-printed model that demonstrates the first law of motion through a floating object suspended by air pressure. When the object is stationary, it will remain at rest unless acted upon by an external force like air currents.
- **Printable Components:**  
  - Air pump mechanism to create air flow  
  - Floating object (lightweight sphere or object)  
  - Base stand with air jets
